                    \\ Duplication leads to a larger codebase, greater potential for bugs (changing one instance but nmot another), and makes code changes more arduous (to find and change duplications).

                \item Often each stage is managed by a separate team.

                \item Tests define the public api \& vice-versa.
                \item Programming to satisfy tests requires altering program internals (implementation details).
                \item Refactoring alters the structure but not behaviour (structural design), keepuing the code in a green state.
