    \section*{MapReduce}
        A system built by Google to work on very large datasets, allowing data processing tasks to be spread over many computers in a farm.
        \\
        The main difficulties win distributed computing considered were:
        \compitem{
            \item If many projects are changed to be distributed, then lots of code must be changed, much will be duplicated \& there is potential for bugs.
            \item Ordinging interactions and sharing data across many networked computers is difficult.
            \item Probability of a hardware failure grows with the amount of hardware.
        }
        MapReduce takes tasks written by programmers, and distributises it across a number of systems, handling failures \& can be easily used through an \keyword{API}. 
        Furthermore any improvements to the system will immediately be reflected in all projects using it.
        \\
        \\ Google wanted to index the world wide web, this is a large problem that is best suited to highly distributed programming.

        The shuffle stage is important, to increase performance we want to transmit/copy the minimum amount of data between computers.
        \\
        \\ For \keyword{MapReduce} the signatures are different to lists \& integers:
        \[map: (k_1,v_1) \to list(k_2, v_2)\]
        \[reduce: list(k_2, list(v_2)) \to list(k_2, v_2)\]
        For example:
        We have $k_1 = \text{line number}$ and $v_1 = \text{line of text}$

        \subsubsection*{Alternatives}
            Other projects have been developed to perform a similar role to \keyword{MapReduce} such as \keyword{Hadoop}.
