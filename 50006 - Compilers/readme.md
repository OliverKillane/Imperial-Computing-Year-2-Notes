## Plans
I need to make these notes complete:

ðŸ”´ Create notes for all Prof Kelly & Dulay's Lectures.

ðŸ”´ Update Image quality by exporting higher resolutions, or switching to svg.

ðŸ”´ Create a Unified notes document from all lecture materials.

ðŸ”´ Create flashcards for subject content.
