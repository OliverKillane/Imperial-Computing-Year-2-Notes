                \item No setup cost.

                \item Space cost associated with containing independent information in each and every packet.
                \item Quality of service is difficult to guarantee (no connection, processing and switching overhead, others can start using links as no reservation).
                \item High network resource utilisation (can send packets different routes in parallel, two connections can work on shared communication links)

        Processing delay $d_{proc}$:
        \compitem {
            \item Check for bit errors.
            \item Determine output link.
            \item Negligible (<msec).
        }
        Queueing delay $d_{queue}$:
        \compitem {
            \item time waiting at output link for transmission.
            \item If link is congested, packet might be queued for a long time before being sent.
            \item If in queue too long, packet may be dropped.
        }
        \[\begin{matrix}
            R: \text{ link bandwidth(bps)} & L: \text{ packet length (bits)} & a: \text{ average packet arrival rate} & \cfrac{L \times a}{R}: \text{ traffic intensity} \\
        \end{matrix}\]
        \[\text{Delay } = \begin{cases}
            \text{small} & \cfrac{L \times a}{R} \approx 0 \\
            \text{large} & \cfrac{L \times a}{R} \to 1 \\
            \infty & \cfrac{L \times a}{R} > 1 \\
        \end{cases}\]
        If more work is arriving that can be processed, the delay becomes infinite (and packets will likely be dropped).
