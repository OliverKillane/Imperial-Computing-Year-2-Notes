	}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Decision Problems}
Given:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A set $S$ of finite data structures of some kind (e.g formulae in first order logic).
	\item A property $P$ of elements of $S$ (e.g the porperty of a formula that it has a proof).
\end{itemize}
\sidenote{Formulas} {Well formed logical statements that are a sequence of symbols form a given formal language. e.g $(p \lor q) \land i$ is a formula, but $) \lor \land j i$ is not.}
The associated decision procedure is:
\\
\\ Find an algorithm such that for any $s \in S$, if $s$ has property $P$ the algorithm terminates with $1$, otherwise with $0$.

\subsubsection*{Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem}
\cenqu{Is there an algorithm which can take any statement in first-order logic, and determine in a finite number of steps if the statement is provable?}

\sidenote{First Order Logic}{Also called predicate logic, is an extension of propositional logic that includes quanifiers ($\forall, \exists$), equality, function symbols (e.g $\times, \div, +, -$) and structured formulas (predicate functions).}

This problem was originally presented in a more ambiguous form, using a logic system more powerful than first-order.
\\
\\ '\textit{Entscheidungsproblem}' means 'decision problem'
\\
\\ Many tired to solve the porblem, without success. One strategy was to try and disprove that such an algorithm can exist.
In order to answer this question properly a formal definiotion of algorithm was required.

\subsubsection*{Algorithms Informally}
Common features of Algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
	\bullpara{Finite}{
		Description of the procedure in terms of elementary operations.
	}
	\bullpara{Deterministic}{
		If there is a next step, it is uniquely determined - that is on the same data, the same steps will be made.
	}
	\bullpara{Maybe Terminate}{
		procedure may not terminate on some input data, however we can recognise when it terminates and what the result is.
	}
\end{itemize}

In 1935/35, Alan Turing (Cambridge) and Church (Princeton) independently gave negative soltuions to Hilberts Entscheidungsproblem (showed such an algorithm could not exist).
\begin{enumerate}
	\item They gave concrete/precise definitions of what algorithms are (Turing Machines \& Lambda Calculus).
	\item They regarded algorithms as data, on which other algorithms could act.
	\item They reduced the problem to the \keyword{Halting problem}.
\end{enumerate}
This work led to the Church-Turing Thesis, that shows everything computable is computed by a Turing Machine. Church's Thesis extended this to show that General Recurisve Functions were the same type as those expressed by lambda calculus, and Turning showed that lambda calculus and the turning machine were equivalent.
\subsubsection*{Algorithms Formalised}
Any formal definition of an algorithm should be:
\begin{itemize}
	\bullpara{Precise}{
		No ambiguities, no implicit assumptions, Should be phrased mathematically.
	}
	\bullpara{Simple}{
		No unnecessary details, only the few axioms required. Makes it easier to reason about.
	}
	\bullpara{General}{
		So all algorithms and types of algorithms are covered.
	}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{The Halting Problem}
The \keyword{Halting problem} is a decision problem with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The set of all pairs $(A,D)$ such that $A$ is an algorithm, and $D$ is some input datum on which the algorithm operates.
	\item The property $A(D)\downarrow$ holds for $(A,D) \in S$ if algorithm $A$ when applied to $D$ eventually produces a result (halts).
\end{itemize}
Turning and Church showed that there is no algorithm such that:
\[\forall (A,D) \in S \begin{bmatrix}
		H (A,D) & = & 1 & A(D)\downarrow \\
		        &   & 0 & otherwise
	\end{bmatrix}\]
The final step for Turing/Church's proof was to construct an algorithm encoding instances $(A,D)$ of the halting problem as statements such that:
\[\Phi_{A,D} \ is \ provable \leftrightarrow A(D)\downarrow\]

\subsubsection*{Algorithms as Functions}
It is possible to give a mathematical description of a computable function as a special function between special sets.
\\
\\ In the 1960s Strachey \& Scott (Oxford) introduced \keyword{denotational semantics}, which describes tje meaning (denotation)
of an algorithm as a function that maps input to output.
\sidenote{Domains}{
	Domains are special kinds of partially ordered sets. Partial orders meaning there is an order of elements in the set, but not every element is comparable.
	\\
	\\ Partial orders are reflexive, transitive and anti-symmetric. You can easily represent them on a Hasse Diagram.

	\end{center}
}
Scott solved the most difficult part, considering recursively defined algorithms as continuous functions between domains.


\subsubsection*{Haskell Programs}
Example using a basic implementation of power.
\codelist{Haskell}{power.hs}

\newcommand{\step}[1]{$\leadsto$ \ #1\\}

\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
	\textbf{O(n)} \\
	power 7 5 \\
	\step{7 * (power 7 4)}
	\step{7 * ( 7 * (power 7 3))}
	\step{7 * ( 7 * (7 * (power 7 2)))}
	\step{7 * ( 7 * (7 * (7 * (power 7 1))))}
	\step{7 * ( 7 * (7 * (7 * (7 * (power 7 0)))))}
	\step{7 * ( 7 * (7 * (7 * (7 * 1))))}
	\step{16807}
\end{minipage} \begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
	\textbf{O(log(n)) steps} \\
	power' 7 5 \\
	\step{7 * (power' 7 2)\^2}
	\step{7 * ((power' 7 1)\^2)\^2}
	\step{7 * ((7 * (power' 7 0)\^2)\^2)\^2}
	\step{7 * ((7 * (1)\^2)\^2)\^2}
	\step{16807}
\end{minipage}

These two functions are equivalent in result however operate differently (one much faster than the other).

\subsubsection*{Program Semantics}
\textbf{Denotational Semantics:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A program's meaning is described compositionally using denotations (mathematical objects)
	\item A denotation of a program phrase is built from its subphrases.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Operational Semantics:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Program's meaning is given in terms of the steps taken to make it run.
\end{itemize}
There is also \keyword{axiomatic semantics} and \keyword{declarative semantics} but we will not cover them.
